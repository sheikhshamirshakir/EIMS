# Todos and other improvements

## Improvements
* TESTS!
* Horizontal layout
* More JSDoc
* Create an `Item` class for shuffle items so they can handle storing values and more.

## Things I don't like and would like to fix
* Move everything to Shuffle.prototype.method = function.
* Less jQuery dependency

## Reasons Zepto doesn't work
* `.data()` - although I think it can be included?
* `.filter()` and `.not()` don't work with collections.
* `.css(['style1', 'style2', 'style3'])` isn't supported.
